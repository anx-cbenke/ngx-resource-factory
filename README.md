# ngx-resource-factory

ngx-resource-factory is an Angular library that enables you to work with RESTful APIs in an easy way. The main 
features include a resource store for holding changes on resource instances and related resource instances to commit
them at once, and an advanced resource caching.

**Note:** This library is for Angular 5.x and above!


## In development

This library is currently in an early stage of development and is missing lots of features as well as a proper 
documentation.
